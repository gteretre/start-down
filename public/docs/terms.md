# Terms of Service

Effective Date: 19 May 2025

By using StartDown (“the App”), you agree to these legally binding terms.

1. Eligibility
   You must be at least 16 years old (or meet your country’s legal age of digital consent).

2. User Account
   You are responsible for all activity under your account. Keep your credentials secure.

3. Acceptable Use
   You agree not to:

Post unlawful, harmful, or offensive content (e.g., hate speech, spam, malware)

Infringe on others’ intellectual property

Post political content (to maintain platform neutrality)

Engage in behavior or publish content that, in our sole judgment, undermines the purpose, integrity, or atmosphere of the platform

We may remove content or suspend accounts at our discretion for any behavior deemed incompatible with the community's values, even if not explicitly listed above.

4. User Content
   You retain ownership of your content. By posting, you grant StartDown a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to host, display, and distribute your content within the App.

You must ensure you have the right to post your content. We are not responsible for user-generated content.

5. Moderation and Content Removal
   We reserve the right to remove any content at any time, for any reason, without prior notice or explanation—even if the content does not violate these Terms.

This includes, but is not limited to, content that we find inconsistent with the tone, quality, or neutrality of the platform. We are not obligated to justify removal decisions.

You may contact us if you believe a mistake has been made, but we are not required to respond or reinstate removed content.

6. Copyright
   Report copyright issues to: gteretre@gmail.com. We may remove infringing content and terminate repeat infringers.

7. Data Collection
   See our Privacy Policy for full details on how we collect and use your personal data.

8. Intellectual Property
   All platform materials (excluding user content) are owned by StartDown and protected by intellectual property laws.

9. Modification of Services
   We may modify or discontinue features without prior notice. Where changes affect your rights, we will notify you.

10. Disclaimer
    The App is provided “as is.” We make no warranties and disclaim liability for any loss arising from your use of the App.

11. Limitation of Liability
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, StartDown shall not be liable for indirect or consequential damages.

12. Indemnification
    You agree to indemnify StartDown against claims or damages from your content or breach of these terms.

13. Governing Law
    These terms are governed by the laws of Poland. Any disputes will be resolved in Polish courts.

14. Updates to Terms
    We may update these Terms. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.

15. Contact
