## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gteretre/startdown.git
   cd startdown
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following:
   ```env
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
   AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
   AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
   AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your_google_client_id
   AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
   MONGODB_DB=startdown
   ADMIN=your_email@example.com # Optional, for admin access
   ```
4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
5. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.**

## 🧪 Demo Data

Demo data is available in [`/demo-data/startdown.startups.json`](./demo-data/startdown.startups.json) and [`/demo-data/startdown.authors.json`](./demo-data/startdown.authors.json).

To import the demo data into your local MongoDB instance, run:

```bash
mongoimport --uri="your_local_connection_string" --collection=authors --file=demo-data/startdown.authors.json --jsonArray
mongoimport --uri="your_local_connection_string" --collection=startups --file=demo-data/startdown.startups.json --jsonArray
```

This will populate your database with sample authors and startup ideas for testing and development.

## 🚢 Deployment

To run in Docker:

```bash
docker build -t startdown .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file [.env.local](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) startdown
```

## 💡 About

In the world of tech, everyone's chasing that mythical "unicorn" — the billion-dollar startup idea. So, I thought, why not have a little fun with it? StartDown is my tongue-in-cheek tribute to those wild ideas that might just be brilliant... or totally bonkers. It’s a space where people can throw their craziest concepts into the void (or the internet) and maybe, just maybe, get some feedback. It's also part of my portfolio. A functional joke with real code behind it.
